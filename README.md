<img align="left" width="300px" src="https://pinefore.com/branding/widelogo.svg"/> Pinefore is a new type of internet service, or rather, an old one revitalized for a modern era. It is an internet service that, from the very beginning, has been designed consciously in ways that empower our users. It is a service that intends to foster diversity in our web, at a time when the largest companies are attacking it. It is the result of hundreds of hours spent examining the cultural shifts between 2000-2015. We pine for beautiful gardens of home grown content — bastions of individuality. Through every method possible, our goal is to encourage their growth.

Pinefore plans to launch with full protocol support for

- ActivityPub (est. 2018)
- Delicious/Pinboard (est. 2005)
- RSS (est. 1999)
- Google Reader (est. 2005)
- Fever (est. 2013)

And soon,

- WebMention
- ???

We currently are launching with tightly integrated and communal:

- Bookmarking
- RSS
- Annotations

And we plan to add support for

- Croundfunding à la Coil
- "Small Search"
- Anything else that could foster the indieweb

We are not taking investments. That would be contrary to our goals.
