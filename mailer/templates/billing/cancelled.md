Hi!

As I'm sure you know, you cancelled your account, so you won't be charged unless you renew it. Once your subscription expires, there will be a 30 day courtesy period where your account will remain read-only, but then I'll delete it for your privacy.

I wish it worked out. If there's anything I can do to make the product better please don't hesitate to let me know.

Evan
